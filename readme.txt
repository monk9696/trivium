to run the microtrivium file simply open the file in mips and run the file.
this will run it based of a key of  0x0a0704 and a IV of x0ffffff
to change these values line 14 is what you change for the first byte, 20 for the second byte, and 28 for the third byte of the key, these values only increase bassed off the prior byte
to change the IV changing the value at line 15 will change all 3 bytes to that value
